    <h1>Healthy Eating</h1>
    <p>
        While some extreme diets may suggest otherwise, we all need a balance of protein, fat, carbohydrates,
        fiber, vitamins, and minerals in our diets to sustain a healthy body. You don't need to eliminate
        certain categories of food from your diet, but rather select the healthiest options from each category.
        Healthy eating doesn’t have to be overly complicated. If you feel overwhelmed by all the conflicting nutrition
        and diet advice out there, you’re not alone. It seems that for every expert who tells you a certain food
        is good for you, you’ll find another saying exactly the opposite. The truth is that while some specific foods
        or nutrients have been shown to have a beneficial effect on mood, it’s your overall dietary pattern that is
        most important. The cornerstone of a healthy diet should be to replace processed food with real food
        whenever possible. Eating food that is as close as possible to the way nature made it can make a huge difference
        to the way you think, look, and feel.
        By using these simple tips, you can cut through the confusion and learn how to create—and stick to—a tasty,
        varied, and nutritious diet that is as good for your mind as it is for your body.

   <h1>Add more fruit and vegetables to your diet</h1>
    <p>
        Fruit and vegetables are low in calories and nutrient dense, which means they are packed with vitamins,
        minerals, antioxidants, and fiber. Focus on eating the recommended daily amount of at least five servings of
        fruit and vegetables and it will naturally fill you up and help you cut back on unhealthy foods. A serving
        is half a cup of raw fruit or veg or a small apple or banana, for example. Most of us need to double the
        amount we currently eat.
